# Program Management Module – Functional Documentation

## Overview

This module implements the **Program management logic** inside the system.
It is responsible for handling all operations related to `ProgramCourse` records, including:

* Creating programs
* Updating programs
* Deleting programs
* Retrieving programs
* Searching programs with pagination (Technically used by GetAllPrograms)

This module is consumed internally by controllers and is **not exposed as a standalone public API**.

### Core Program Services and Usage

| Function       | Used By / Entry Point                    | Actual Behavior in System                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getProgramById | Program detail view (GET /program/:id)   | Fetches a single ProgramCourse record by primary key. Used when viewing or editing a specific program.                                                                                  |
| createProgram  | Program creation flow (POST /program)    | Inserts a new ProgramCourse record into the database. Relies on DB unique constraints for validation.                                                                                   |
| updateProgram  | Program edit flow (PUT /program/:id)     | Updates existing ProgramCourse fields based on provided input. Throws error if program does not exist.                                                                                  |
| deleteProgram  | Program management (DELETE /program/:id) | Removes a ProgramCourse record. Delete logic handled in controller, service executes DB operation.                                                                                      |
| searchPrograms | Employee listing (GET /program)          | Performs wildcard search on `name` and `code`, supports pagination using `page` and `limit`, and supports `top` to limit result size. Used to power listing screens and search filters. |

## Search Programs Service

### Function

```
searchPrograms(top,page,limit,search)
```

### Input

```js
{
  search: "CS",
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
}
```

### Behavior

* Performs wildcard search on:

  * `name`
  * `code`
* Uses pagination logic:

  ```
  offset = (page - 1) * limit
  ```
* Queries database using Sequelize `Op.like`

### Output

```js
{
  programs: [...],
}
Above Code Return Programs, But It lacked response code and it must be standardized
```

---

## Program Creation Logic

### Function

```
createProgram(data)
```

### Input

```js
{
  code: "AI01",
  name: "Artificial Intelligence",
  level: "Degree",
  type: "PROGRAM"
}
```

### Behavior

* Directly inserts record into database.
* No manual duplicate checking.
* Database enforces uniqueness using:

  ```
  UNIQUE(code, level, type)
  ```

### Failure Case

* If duplicate exists, database throws constraint error.
* Error propagates to controller.

---

## Delete Program Logic

### Function

```
deleteProgram(id)
```

### Behavior

* Delete logic is handled in `ProgramService`.
* Controller only calls Delete Method In Program Saervice.
* If no rows affected, controller throws error.

---

## Controller Simplification

### What was changed

Removed logic like:

> “Only return response if addProgram is successful”

### Reason

* Service throws exceptions automatically.
* Controllers rely on try/catch.
* Global error handler formats failure.

This results in:

* Linear flow
* Less defensive code
* Proper exception-based design

---

## Database as Single Source of Truth

The service layer no longer performs:

* Duplicate code validation
* Manual integrity checks

Because:

* Database already enforces business rules.
* This avoids logic duplication.
* Prevents race conditions.

---

## Execution Flow (Internal)

```
Controller → ProgramService → Sequelize → Database
```

No external consumers.
No network boundary.
Pure internal business logic.

---

## Why This Matters (Engineering Perspective)

This refactor achieved:

* Removal of redundant validations
* Trust in DB constraints
* Clean service contracts
* Predictable error flow
* Maintainable architecture

This is **how real backend systems are written**:

> Services enforce behavior, database enforces truth, controllers orchestrate.

---

## One-line Summary (Internal Docs / CV)

> Refactored Program management module by introducing search with pagination, simplifying controller logic, removing redundant validations, and relying on database constraints for data integrity.
> This is **service-level engineering**, not API design — and that’s actually more impressive technically.
